"""
I calculated the trade-off between salary and equity by comparing the total value of the shares over the
4-year vesting period with the total additional salary Iâ€™m requesting over the same timeframe. Since shares
are granted with a 4-year vesting schedule, it makes sense to compare them to the full salary I would earn
in that period. For example, increasing the salary by 1,000 kr/month results in an additional 48,000 kr
over 4 years. At todays share price, this corresponds to about 218 shares. So to keep total
compensation balanced, a higher salary would fairly come with a proportional reduction in equity based
on current share value.
